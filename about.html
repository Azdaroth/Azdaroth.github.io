  Hi! I'm Karol, I'm a Ruby on Rails expert and distributed systems architect, currently working as CTO at <a href="https://www.bookingsync.com" target="_blank">BookingSync</a>.
</p>

<p>Thanks to over 10 years of experience, working on difficult challenges and being committed to learning new things every day and reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/40212012">all books I can find</a> on the relevant topics, I had a chance to solve a variety of problems. Here are some notable initiatives I've had a chance to lead:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace HTTP API-based data synchronization between services with Kafka-based Change Data Capture using <a href="http://github.com/BookingSync/dionysus-rb" target="_blank">a custom framework</a> decreasing the average latency of data synchronization between services from over 30 minutes to sub-5 seconds (over 350x improvement), at the same using less than 30% resources (CPU, memory) on the consumers side compared to the previous architecture</li>
  <li>Grow engineering team from 5 to over 20 team members with scarce finances without VC funding</li>
  <li>Introduce event-based architecture and communication between services via RabbitMQ using <a href="http://github.com/BookingSync/hermes-rb" target="_blank">a custom framework</a></li>
  <li>Build PCI DSS compliant platform for credit data processing and maintain compliance through multiple years</li>
  <li>Migrate from legacy <a href="https://github.com/teamhephy/workflow">Hephy Workflow PaaS</a> and self-hosted Kubernetes to a modern infra built on top of AWS EKS, Helm, ArgoCD, Jenkins</li>
  <li>Migrate 5 self-managed PostgreSQL clusters to AWS RDS service using AWS DMS</li>
  <li>Migrate 3 self-managed Redis cluster to AWS ElasiCache</li>
  <li>Decrease AWS infrastructure cost by approximately 35% through different initiatives (including the migrations mentioned above)</li>
  <li>Introduce <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124" target="_blank">SPACE Framework</a> as a developer productivity framework</li>
</ul>

<p>My CTO archetype is an <i>architect</i> - while I've been de-facto VP of Engineering and also acting as engineering manager focusing on people management, I'm at my best when I design systems and keep my hands at least a little dirty, even if it's just a prototype or a proof of concept.</p>

<p>
  I strongly believe in <strong>always giving back</strong>. That's why I've been involed in <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/open-source/" targe="_blank">many open source projects</a>  and have been sharing knowledge on multiple occasions (including writing a <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/test-driven-ember/" target="_blank">book</a> and releasing it for free).
