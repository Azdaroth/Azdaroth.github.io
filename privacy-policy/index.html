<p>
It might look quite surprising that a small <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com" target="_blank">Website</a> like this has the privacy policy. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that some of your personal data is collected whenever you visit this Website or interact with it, for example when writing a comment.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that you might want to know is that I use <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>. However, I don't collect any of your personal data - even your IP is not stored as the anonymization feature is enabled.
</p>

<p>
I use <a href=“http://getform.io”>GetForm</a> as a backend for the contact form. If you don’t want your email to be kept there, please refrain from submitting the form. You can also ask me to delete it.
</p>

<p>
I also use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a> for email subscriptions and <a href="https://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a> for comments. You have to perform explicit actions to be involved anyhow with these services, and as a result, I might be able to see some of your personal data, such as an e-mail or an IP. I never distribute this data to any third party services, so this is not something you need to worry about. If you are still not happy about that and you have already subscribed or have written any comment, you can unsubscribe anytime using MailChimp, delete your Disqus comment or ask me to delete it.
