    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Microservices</strong>, <strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong> and in general, <strong>distributed ecosystems</strong>, have been on hype in the last several years. And that&rsquo;s for a good reason! At certain point, The <strong>Majestic Monolith</strong> &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; might start causing issues, both from the purely technical reasons like scalability, tight coupling of the code if you don&rsquo;t follow <strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong> or some other practices <strong>improving modularity</strong>, maintenance overhead, and also from organizational perspective since working in smaller teams on smaller apps is more efficient than working with huge team on an even bigger monolith which suffers from tight coupling and low cohesion. However, this is only true if the overall architecture addresses the potential problems that are common in the micro/macro-services world. One of these problems I would like to focus on is communication between apps and how the data flows between them.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>How Can The Applications Talk To Each Other</h2>

<p>There are multiple ways the applications could talk to each other but let&rsquo;s focus on the most popular ones: shared database, HTTP API and messages.</p>

<h3>Shared Database</h3>

<p>It is arguable if we can talk about apps communicating with each other in this scenario; nevertheless, it&rsquo;s one of the ways to solve the problem of getting data from one application to another. And apart from some particular scenarios, it&rsquo;s the way that could give you a lot of headaches quite soon.</p>

<p>Initially, it might look like a great idea &ndash; you connect the other app to an existing database, and you don&rsquo;t need to worry about the communication! If the other application is just responsible for reading from that database, maybe you won&rsquo;t have any severe problems beyond increased load, issues of scaling and questionable access control (by default, the other app can do anything to that database). However, if you have multiple applications writing to the same database, you will undoubtedly have more serious issues &ndash; deadlocks, problems with data consistency as different constraints might apply to different applications, schema getting out of control with each application adding some custom tables and fields, which can turn out to be quite nasty &ndash; imagine one application acquiring Access Exclusive Lock on the entire table which turns out to be large (so the lock will not be released any time soon) thanks to some migration, while the other app was supposed to do some business-critical operations on that table that were also time-sensitive. Some of these problems are RDBMS-specific like locking during migration, but there is a very good chance anyway that you will be using either MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>There are just too many things that can go wrong with having shared database that I would highly discourage from even trying that approach, maybe besides one single scenario &ndash; when what you need is exactly a replication of some data, e.g., to generate reports. In that case, you can set up PostgreSQL logical replication and let it replicate the data from the primary data source to a read-only replica containing only the data the application needs. Since PostgreSQL has a very reliable replication mechanism, you don&rsquo;t need to reinvent the wheel, and you can take advantage of that feature. Keep in mind that logical replication was introduced in PostgreSQL 10, so it&rsquo;s not available in the previous versions.</p>

<h3>HTTP API</h3>

<p>HTTP APIs, especially the RESTful APIs (although GraphQL has been getting quite popular in the last years), are arguably the most common blocks in microservices architecture as far as the communication between applications goes. REST architecture goes very well with HTTP, the communication between client and server is synchronous which makes it easy to reason about and debug, HTTP APIs are ubiquitous, and the developers are familiar with working with them. Also, HATEOAS and capabilities of getting precisely what you need from GraphQL make using with HTTP APIs easy, especially when working with Third-Party applications. Also, there is a lot of flexibility in implementing access control and authentication. On top of that, there are <a href="https://jsonapi.org">specifications</a> that clearly define how JSON APIs should be built, which minimizes reinventing the wheel and makes it even easier to build a client for that kind of API.</p>

<p>Based on those advantages it might look like communication between services via JSON APIs is the best possible solution to the problem, right?</p>

<p>Well, not necessarily. If you have one or two applications communicating with some other application, maybe it&rsquo;s not a bad idea, especially if the traffic is not huge and you don&rsquo;t need to transfer gigabytes of JSON daily via HTTP.</p>

<p>However, what if you expect a massive load from the services and indeed you will be transferring gigabytes of JSON via HTTP? Do you really need flexible authorization for communication between internal services? And why deal with an extra overhead of non-persistent connections and SSL handshakes in the first place?</p>

<p>Those things are great for integration with Third-Party applications, but they bring very little value in a closed ecosystem. Nevertheless, that overhead is not the biggest problem here, let&rsquo;s discuss something way more problematic: scaling.</p>

<p>Imagine that the API of one application is exposed to multiple other applications in your ecosystem. Also, the same application is used by &ldquo;real&rdquo; users who interact with it via UI. The immediate problem we have with that approach is that the traffic generated by the other services will be affecting regular users, which makes scaling decisions more tricky. To make it more complicated, let&rsquo;s say that in our example ecosystem we have a lot of data, and each application will be reading gigabytes of data every day and each service fetches data periodically from the API, e.g., every 5 minutes. To limit the number of requests so that we don&rsquo;t fetch the data that has been already fetched by the applications, we may want to implement some sort of data offset, which most likely will be based on the timestamp of the last fetch. We could send this timestamp that will filter out the records that haven&rsquo;t changed after that time and drastically reduce the number of requests that way. However, in a big enough scale, that will not be enough to solve all the issues. There can be thousands of records to be fetched every 5 minutes, which will most likely be paginated &ndash; that means a lot of requests. Multiply it by the number of applications and the traffic looks even more depressing, especially if every application will fetch exactly the same data.</p>

<p>Either the answer to the problem will be caching, which might be tricky to implement since the services will be using timestamp-based offset, or we can switch from pull-based strategy to push-based strategy.</p>

<p>A push-based strategy will be a publish-subscribe pattern via HTTP. The benefit of that is that we could serialize the state of the record after every change only once (or just serialize a changeset and go in the direction of CQRS/Event Sourcing) and send the payload to every service subscribed to a given event. The benefit of this approach is serializing a payload only once instead of doing it on every request, we can avoid useless requests which might happen if nothing has changed in the last 5 minutes and we could balance the load efficiently by moving the delivery logic to some background jobs. The disadvantage of publish-subscribe via HTTP, a.k.a. webhooks, would be implementing HTTP APIs in every service. Also, each application will experience massive traffic on a large enough scale.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great if your ecosystem offers this kind of features for limiting the number of requests to Third-Party Applications, but is it the most efficient way of handling communication between internal applications and scaling the ecosystem?</p>

<p>This type of communication is arguably quite common in the microservices world, and the funny thing is that in some aspects it&rsquo;s no different than reimplementing messaging systems, but done in a less effective way.</p>

<p>There is a more efficient way to deal with the communication between internal services: using asynchronous messaging.</p>

<h3>Asynchronous Messaging</h3>

<p>Async messaging is a communication approach where a middleware, called message broker, connects producers of messages with consumers of those messages. Usually, a producer sends messages and the message broker is responsible for delivering them to proper consumers.</p>

<p>Thanks to having a message broker in-between the services, not only do we benefit from extra decoupling between the applications, but also we have way more flexibility as far as scalability goes.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at two very popular message brokers that take different approaches to messages: <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> and <a href="http://kafka.apache.org">Apache Kafka</a></p>

<h4>RabbitMQ</h4>

<p>RabbitMQ is a general purpose message broker supporting multiple protocols from which AMQP will be the one most interesting one to us. It implements a smart broker/dumb consumer model, which means the broker is responsible for delivering messages to the right place.</p>

<p>The essential design decision in RabbitMQ is that the producers shouldn&rsquo;t directly push messages to the queues, from which the consumers can read messages and process them. Instead, producers send messages to exchanges, and the queues are connected to these exchanges. That way, the producer doesn&rsquo;t know where exactly the message will be delivered and how many consumers are going to do anything with it if any! This kind of decoupling not only allows implementation of the publish-subscribe pattern, where multiple consumers using different queues bind to the same exchange and process the same message, but it also opens the way to quite a flexible routing (which we will cover in more details in the next part of this series). Once the consumer acknowledges the message, it is removed from the queue. Multiple producers can also subscribe to the same queue which will make them compete for the messages. The communication in a simple scenario as described above is illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<p class="img-center-wrapper">

</p>




<p class="center">
  <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/images/messages_on_rails_part_1/rabbitmq.png" target="_blank">See in better quality</a>
</p>


<p>RabbitMQ is an excellent choice if you have complex routing scenarios, priority queues, you don&rsquo;t care about keeping messages in the queue after they are processed, and you don&rsquo;t expect an extreme throughput (although 100k messages/s that you can get in some <a href="https://www.cloudamqp.com/plans.html">RabbitMQ As A Service solutions</a>, even in a high availability scenario, is in most cases more than enough).</p>

<h4>Kafka</h4>

<p>Kafka is a distributed streaming platform which takes a different approach than RabbitMQ &ndash; it implements a dumb broker/smart consumer model. In that case,  it is the responsibility of the consumers to fetch messages and keep track of their state. What is unique about Kafka is the fact that it is not a message queue &ndash; it is an append-only log. Producers send messages to the topics, to which consumers subscribe and read the messages and keep the offset which is the information about the position in the log until which the messages were read. It can be illustrated the following way:</p>

<p><img src="/images/messages_on_rails_part_1/kafka.png" title="&lsquo;Kafka&rsquo; &lsquo;Kafka&rsquo;" ></p>

<p class="center">
  <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/images/messages_on_rails_part_1/kafka.png" target="_blank">See in better quality</a>
</p>


<p>Such a design opens a way to some interesting features. The log is persistent with configurable retention which can be based on the size or time how long the events should be kept in the log, which makes Kafka act like a circular buffer. To save some space, Kafka allows log compaction when the messages are sent with the same key, keeping only the last one as a result. If storage is not an issue, you might even decide never to delete any messages!</p>

<p>On top of that, Kafka can easily handle a massive throughput &ndash; 100 000 messages/second is not extraordinary, it&rsquo;s easy to scale, and there are <a href="https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/files/slides/Kafka%20At%20Scale.pdf">cases</a> of handling millions of messages per second.</p>

<p>A persistent log is a killer-feature of Kafka. When you add another service to your ecosystem and need to get the data from one app to another, you will run into obvious issues when using a traditional message queue since the messages are gone after they are processed. With Kafka, just can add a new consumer and replay all the past events! You can also combine Kafka with stream processing frameworks like <a href="http://samza.apache.org">Apache Samza</a>, <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a>, <a href="http://storm.apache.org">Apache Storm</a>,<a href="https://www.confluent.io/product/ksql/">KSQL</a> or use Kafka Streams.</p>

<p>Kafka is an excellent choice for use cases where the routing is not complex, the throughput is substantial, the messages need to stay in the log (even indefinitely) and where you expect the need to replay messages. You can also do Event Sourcing with Kafka and use stream processor like Kafka Stream or KSQL to construct projections from the events.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>Communication</strong> between multiple services in a <strong>distributed ecosystem</strong> is far from a trivial problem, which can be approached in various ways: via a <strong>shared database</strong> (although to a very limited extent), <strong>HTTP APIs</strong> or <strong>messages</strong>.</p>

<p>In the next parts I&rsquo;ll be focusing on <strong>Kafka</strong> and <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> &ndash; how they work and how to use them in Rails applications, how to produce and consume messages, what kind of extra options you get by introducing Kafka and RabbitMQ to your ecosystem, potential issues you might have in some specific scenarios and show some examples where combining both could bring benefits.</p>

    <id>https://karolgalanciak.com/blog/2019/01/27/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-a-default-and-provided-value-for-optional-arguments-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is sometimes required for the methods with optional arguments to be able to differentiate between its default value and the value passed from the caller. Passing <code>nil</code> might initially sound like a good idea since it represents &ldquo;nothingness&rdquo;. However, it might turn out that <code>nil</code> is a legit value and there might be cases where it is desirable for the caller to pass <code>nil</code>. In such a case, we cannot use it as a default value if we want to implement a special logic for the case of not providing that value.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is an easy way to deal with it &ndash; use a special constant:</p>

<p>``` rb
class SomeClass
  NO_VALUE_PROVIDED = Object.new
  private_constant :NO_VALUE_PROVIDED</p>

<p>  def call(argument: NO_VALUE_PROVIDED)</p>

<pre><code>if argument == NO_VALUE_PROVIDED
  handle_scenario_for_no_value_provided
else
  do_something_with_argument(argument)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>In <code>call</code> method, we allow to pass an optional argument with a default of <code>NO_VALUE_PROVIDED</code>, which is a private constant defined in that class that is an instance of <code>Object</code>.</p>

<p>By depending on the instance of <code>Object</code> that is initialized inside that class, we can avoid cases where the equality check returns <code>true</code> even if this is not an expected outcome, which could happen if we used strings or symbols. We could use some symbol that would be very unlikely to be passed from the caller, like <code>:__no_value_provided__,</code> but it arguably looks more like a workaround than a dedicated solution for the problem.</p>

<p>Also, a private constant ensures it is not used anywhere outside the class, which minimizes the chances that the passed argument would the same as our placeholder for no-value-provided scenario even more.</p>

    <link href="https://karolgalanciak.com/blog/2018/12/16/inheritance-and-define-method-how-to-make-them-work-together/"/>
    <updated>2018-12-16T20:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>https://karolgalanciak.com/blog/2018/12/16/inheritance-and-define-method-how-to-make-them-work-together</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Imagine that you are implementing some form object because you are fed up with treating ActiveRecord models as such, and you need some extra flexibility. You start with a straightforward implementation for a base class of a form object where you can just whitelist attributes. That could look like this:</p>

<p>``` rb
class FormObject
  def self.attributes_registry</p>

<pre><code>@attributes_registry ||= []
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.attribute(attribute_name)</p>

<pre><code>attributes_registry &lt;&lt; attribute_name

define_method(attribute_name) do
  instance_variable_get("@#{attribute_name}")
end

define_method("#{attribute_name}=") do |value|
  instance_variable_set("@#{attribute_name}", value)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Since the base class is ready, you can create a first form object that would inherit from this class:</p>

<p><code>rb
class MyForm &lt; FormObject
  attribute :some_attribute
end
</code></p>

<p>Initially, it does the job, but then it turns out that you might need a default value if <code>some_attribute</code> turns out to be nil. So you try something like that:</p>

<p>``` rb
class MyFormWithDefaultValue &lt; FormObject
  attribute :some_attribute</p>

<p>  def some_attribute</p>

<pre><code>super || "Default"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>After checking if the default value works, this is what you get:</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>MyFormWithDefaultValue.new.some_attribute
=> NoMethodError: super: no superclass method `some_attribute' for #&lt;MyFormWithDefaultValue:0x007f84a50ae8e0>
```</p></blockquote>

<p>Whoops! How did it happen? The method was defined in the superclass so it should be inheritable, right?</p>

<p>Well, this is not really true. However, the problem is easy to fix.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Anatomy Of The Problem</h2>

<p>The primary question we should answer in the first place is: where are all those new methods defined using <code>define_method</code> in that particular way? Is it a superclass?</p>

<p><code>
 FormObject.instance_methods - Object.methods
 =&gt; []
</code></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not a superclass &ndash; there are no any instance methods defined there, there are only the ones inherited from <code>Object</code>. What about <code>MyFormWithDefaultValue</code>?</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>MyFormWithDefaultValue.instance_methods &ndash; Object.methods
 => [:some_attribute, :some_attribute=]
```</p></blockquote>

<p>Now the error that we initially got makes way more sense. The entire issue is caused by the fact that the declaration of the attribute happens in <code>MyFormWithDefaultValue</code>, if it were defined in a base class, there would be no any issue. We can verify it with a simple example:</p>

<p>``` rb
class MyForm &lt; FormObject
  attribute :some_attribute
end</p>

<p>class MyFormWithDefaultValue &lt; MyForm
  def some_attribute</p>

<pre><code>super || "Default"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>MyFormWithDefaultValueA.new.some_attribute
 => &ldquo;Default&rdquo;
```</p></blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Now that we fully understand the problem let&rsquo;s think about the solution. Ideally, about the one, that doesn&rsquo;t require defining explicitly an intermediate class that we can inherit from.</p>

<p>How about defining a module instead? Modules are also included in the inheritance chain, and for using <code>super</code>, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the method is defined in the class or a module.</p>

<p>The exact solution to the problem would be wrapping the definition of new methods that happens in <code>FormObject</code> inside some module, it could be even an anonymous one, and including it right away:</p>

<p>```
class FormObject
  def self.attributes_registry</p>

<pre><code>@attributes_registry ||= []
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def self.attribute(attribute_name)</p>

<pre><code>attributes_registry &lt;&lt; attribute_name

wrapper = Module.new do
  define_method(attribute_name) do
    instance_variable_get("@#{attribute_name}")
  end

  define_method("#{attribute_name}=") do |value|
    instance_variable_set("@#{attribute_name}", value)
  end
end
include wrapper
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s verify if the new solution works:</p>

<p>```</p>

<blockquote><p>MyFormWithDefaultValue.new.some_attribute
 => &ldquo;Default&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>```</p>

<p>Yay! It does exactly what we wanted to achieve.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Metaprogramming in Ruby is a powerful tool, however; it can lead to some issues that might not be obvious why they happen. Fortunately, with enough knowledge of the language, those problems can be solved elegantly.</p>

    <link href="https://karolgalanciak.com/blog/2018/09/30/the-problems-with-validating-activerecord-models-and-why-state-validation-is-a-bad-idea/"/>
    <updated>2018-09-30T20:00:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>https://karolgalanciak.com/blog/2018/09/30/the-problems-with-validating-activerecord-models-and-why-state-validation-is-a-bad-idea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the typical <strong>Rails application</strong>, you can find the most of the validations in the <strong>ActiveRecord models</strong>, which is nothing surprising &ndash; ActiveRecord models are used for multiple things. Whether it is a good thing, or a bad thing (in most cases it&rsquo;s the latter) deserves a separate book or at least blog post-series as it&rsquo;s not a simple problem, there is one specific thing that can cause <strong>a lot of issues</strong> that are <strong>difficult to solve</strong> and go beyond <strong>design decisions</strong> and ease of maintenance of the application, something that impacts the behavior of the model &ndash; <strong>the validations</strong>.</p>

<p>Just to give you a real-world example of what validation in ActiveRecord model looks like (as impossible as it seems, it really did happen) &ndash; when updating the check-in time of the reservation, which is a simple attribute on Reservation model, the record turned out to be invalid because&hellip; the format of guest&rsquo;s phone didn&rsquo;t match some regexp.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to bypass this problem: use <code>validate: false</code> flag with <code>save</code> method: <code>save(validate: false)</code> or use <code>update_columns</code> method, but this is definitely not something that can be applied in a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; use case. In a typical scenario, this will be the error message displayed in the UI/returned to API consumer, and it will be confusing.</p>

<p>However, this is the expected behavior of ActiveRecord (or in general, ActiveModel-style) validations, which is <strong>a validation of the state</strong> of the model. And judging from this example, it&rsquo;s evident that it leads to <strong>problematic scenarios</strong>. What kind of design then would be the most appropriate to <strong>prevent such issues</strong>?</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Forget State Validation</h2>

<p>Based on the previous example, it&rsquo;s clear that the real problem is the idea of a model&rsquo;s state validation. And the more complex state of the models can be (especially if there are some cross-validations between several models, which is not uncommon in complex applications), the more problems you will get.</p>

<p>Just wanted to update some <code>notes</code> attribute to add some quick info about something? Forget it &ndash; you will get three different validation errors that will tell you that someone&rsquo;s email has an invalid format, description is too short, a discount amount of something is invalid.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is the typical Rails Way of handling validations. In the initial phase of the application, this is certainly convenient &ndash; adding new validations is super easy, there is no need to discuss the design of potential alternatives and how it fits the bigger picture, and there is very little overhead. Unless you are ok with such problems, at some point, you will probably need to migrate validations to some other solution. What would be the potential alternative for validations?</p>

<h2>Validate The Actual Use Case</h2>

<p>The answer to that question is straight-forward (although it doesn&rsquo;t mean that achieving it will be simple) &ndash; just validate the thing you are doing, the actual use case. If you want to update <code>description</code>, you should only be concerned with the description &ndash; if it&rsquo;s present or not, it&rsquo;s length, etc., whether <code>headline</code> is too short or not (this can happen when you change the validation rules and don&rsquo;t somehow migrate the data) is not the subject of that use case.</p>

<p>There are a lot of implications of such approach &ndash; indeed, it will result in different sets of validators per creation and per update, since for creation we usually need way more data, and for an update, we may merely want to update a single attribute. Effectively, it will result in different validation pipelines for create and update actions. For creating, we may always need to apply specific validators (e.g., presence validators for some attributes), but for updating it will make more sense to apply only the validators for what we are trying to do &ndash; when we want to update email, we apply the presence and format validation for an email, if we want to update a description, we apply presence and length validators for a description.</p>

<h2>Potential Implementation</h2>

<p>What would be the way to implement it? The specific design is out of the scope of this article as it might require building mini-framework for validations and consider some design implications on the entire application (especially if we are escaping the traditional Rails Way). However, one thing is sure here &ndash; there will be dedicated validator objects, probably different for create and update action, and the validations will need to be removed from ActiveRecord models.</p>

<p>A potential way of interacting with such objects could look like this:</p>

<p><code>rb
validation_result = Reservation::CreateValidator.call(params)
if validation_result.success?
  # handle happy path here
else
  puts validation_result.errors.messages # for convenience and familiarity, `errors` object could have a similar interface to ActiveModel::Errors
end
</code></p>

<p>What if we need the model itself in the validator due to some complex business rules, like cross-model validation? We could either reuse <code>id</code> from <code>params</code> or just provide <code>model</code> as an argument:</p>

<p><code>rb
validation_result = Reservation::CreateValidator.call(record, params)
</code></p>

<h2>Side-Effects Of Such Design</h2>

<p>The implications of such design go far deeper than just moving things from one place to another to prevent some edge cases (and naturally increasing the complexity of the design, but it seems to be a fair price to pay for what we get as a result). Since it would make the most sense to have validations per use case, then&hellip; maybe we can have use case as objects that would expose their constraints, and the validators would take the rules from those objects and apply some specific logic on top of it to achieve the desired result? Maybe we could even create value objects composed of a single or multiple attributes, e.g. <code>Client::Email</code> object that would enforce its constraints and also, move some logic specific to the email itself in the context of a hypothetical <code>Client</code> model? And if we can identify the use cases themselves, aren&rsquo;t they domain events? And how hard would it be to build event-based architecture, or even apply Event Sourcing?</p>

<p>These are not trivial questions, however, doing one change in the design opens
the door to a holistic architectural approach where all parts of the domain fit together and the interaction between them is way more intentional comparing to ad hoc duct-tape-like solutions.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Putting <strong>too much logic</strong> in <strong>ActiveRecord models</strong> has a lot of disadvantages, most of them being problematic on the <strong>design level</strong>. However, things like validations can result in some nasty issues that go beyond the maintenance and cause actual business problems. Fortunately, by keeping that in mind and putting the <strong>validation logic</strong> in a <strong>separate object(s)</strong>, we can easily avoid such issues and as a nice side-effect, have a design that is way more flexible, extendible and eventually simpler to maintain.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever worked with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, especially in <strong>pre-SPA/pre-frameworks</strong> era with just <strong>jQuery</strong>, you probably had a chance to see an &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; maths in action that looks similar to this:</p>

<p><code>javascript
"3" + 4
// =&gt; "34"
</code></p>

<p>That kind of behavior usually comes as a <strong>big surprise</strong> and due to that fact, JavaScript has gotten some <strong>bad reputation</strong> (even though there is a <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/blog/2017/01/22/javascript-the-surprising-parts/">rationale</a> behind it). If we tried that in <strong>Ruby</strong>, we would get an obvious <code>TypeError</code>:</p>

<p>``` ruby
&ldquo;3&rdquo; + 4</p>

<h1>=> TypeError (no implicit conversion of Integer into String)</h1>

<p>```</p>

<p>Would it be possible though to obtain the same result somehow in Ruby?</p>

<h2>Explicit Conversion vs. Implicit Conversion</h2>

<p>The answer is yes! But before we get to the actual implementation of that concept, let&rsquo;s make sure that we understand some essential concepts in Ruby that will lead us there: <strong>explicit conversion</strong> and <strong>implicit conversion</strong>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably used methods like <code>to_s</code>, <code>to_i</code>, <code>to_d</code>, <code>to_a</code> etc. for <em>explicit</em> typecasting. That way, we can get the closest representation of a given object in a different type.</p>

<p>However, there is also a second type of conversion in Ruby, which is <strong>implicit conversion</strong>.  Those are the methods like <code>to_str</code>, <code>to_int</code>, <code>to_hash</code>, <code>to_ary</code>. In most cases, you should not use those methods unless you are implementing an object that kind of behaves like some type, so, e.g., all numeric objects could (and they actually do!) implement <code>to_int</code> method as they are kind of the same type. For the same reason, if we were implementing some type of collection, we could implement <code>to_ary</code> method that would just return the same result as <code>to_a</code>  which would be an instance of Array, but that we way put extra emphasis on the fact that this object behaves like an array.</p>

<p>We could also take advantage of implicit conversion to put some extra boundaries on the collaborating objects.  Implicit conversion is widely used in Ruby for that purpose. When you are adding a string to a string like this:</p>

<p><code>rb
"3" + "4"
</code></p>

<p>Ruby under the hood calls &ldquo;4&rdquo;.to_str to get the string representation of that object (which is already a string) to make <code>+</code> method more flexible, but at the same time, it makes sure that only string-like objects are permitted as arguments.</p>

<h2>Hijacking Implicit Conversion</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the original problem which was: how to get the following result in Ruby?</p>

<p>``` ruby
&ldquo;3&rdquo; + 4</p>

<h1>=> &ldquo;34&rdquo;</h1>

<p><code>``
Based on what we've just learned about implicit conversion, we just need to make sure that integers become somehow string-like objects. Let's monkey patch</code>Integer<code>class and add</code>to_str<code>method that would be an alias to</code>to_s`:</p>

<p>```
class Integer
  def to_str</p>

<pre><code>to_s
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try out crazy maths again:</p>

<p><code>ruby
"3" + 4
=&gt; "34"
</code></p>

<p>Try the same for JavaScript and compare the results, it should be exactly the same.</p>

<h2>Wrapping up</h2>

<p><strong>Ruby</strong> is an extremely <strong>flexible</strong> language which makes is it easy to do crazy things, just like it is the case with some operations in <strong>JavaScript</strong> ;).</p>
