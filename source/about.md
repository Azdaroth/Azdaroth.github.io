Hi! I'm Karol, I'm a distributed systems architect and a domain expert in vacation rental industry, currently working as CTO at <a href="https://www.bookingsync.com" target="_blank">BookingSync</a>.

Thanks to multiple years of experience, working on difficult challenges and being committed to learning new things every day, I had a chance to solve a variety of problems. The things I particularly enjoy working on and are areas of my expertise are:

- distribitued systems <strong>architecture</strong>
- building <strong>microservices</strong>
- building highly-performant <strong>REST APIs</strong>
- large scale Rails applications
- payments/credit card processing and <strong>PCI DSS</strong> compliant <strong>platforms</strong>
- <strong>working with legacy applications</strong> and making them maintainable

I strongly believe in <strong>always giving back</strong>. That's why I've been involed in many open source projects and have been sharing knowledge on multiple occasions (including writing a <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/test-driven-ember/" target="_blank">book</a> and releasing it for free for everyone). I'm always happy to do paid <strong>open souce</strong> work, <strong>mentor developers</strong> and write <strong>guest blog posts</strong>.
