Hi! I'm Karol, I'm a distributed systems architect and a domain expert in vacation rental industry, currently working as CTO at <a href="https://www.bookingsync.com" target="_blank">BookingSync</a>.

Thanks to multiple years of experience, working on difficult challenges and being committed to learning new things every day, I had a chance to solve a variety of problems. Here are some things that I particularly enjoy working on and are areas of my expertise:

- distribitued systems <strong>architecture</strong> with a strong emphasis on using <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> and/or <strong>Kafka</strong> and <strong>event-driven</strong> design
- building <strong>microservices</strong>
- <strong>performance</strong> optimizations (yes, Rails certainly can scale)
- payments/credit card processing and building <strong>PCI DSS</strong> compliant <strong>platforms</strong>
- <strong>working with legacy applications</strong>, including refactoring and making them maintainable

I strongly believe in <strong>always giving back</strong>. That's why I've been involed in many open source projects and have been sharing knowledge on multiple occasions (including writing a <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/test-driven-ember/" target="_blank">book</a> and releasing it for free). I'm always happy to do paid <strong>open souce</strong> work, <strong>mentor developers</strong> and write <strong>guest blog posts</strong>.

If you need a consulting in any areas of my expertise or just want to say "hi", feel free to use the form below and send me a message.
