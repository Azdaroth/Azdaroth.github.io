<article class="about-root-page">
  <p>Hi! I'm Karol, I'm a distributed systems architect and a domain expert in vacation rental industry, currently working as CTO at <a href="https://www.bookingsync.com" target="_blank">BookingSync</a>.</p>

  <p>Thanks to multiple years of experience, working on difficult challenges and being committed to learning new things every day, I had a chance to solve a variety of problems. The things I particularly enjoy working on and are areas of my expertise are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>distribitued systems <strong>architecture</strong></li>
    <li>building <strong>microservices</strong></li>
    <li>building highly-performant <strong>REST APIs</strong></li>
    <li>large scale Rails applications</li>
    <li>payments/credit card processing and <strong>PCI DSS</strong> compliant </strong>platforms</strong></li>
    <li><strong>working with legacy applications</strong> and making them maintainable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I strongly believe in <strong>always giving back</strong>. That's why I've been involed in many open source projects and have been sharing knowledge on multiple occasions (including writing a <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/test-driven-ember/" target="_blank">book</a> and releasing it for free for everyone). I'm always happy to do paid <strong>open souce</strong> work, <strong>mentor developers</strong> and write <strong>guest blog posts</strong>.</p>
