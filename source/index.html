<article class="about-root-page">
  <p>Hi! I'm Karol, a remote <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>Ember.js</strong> consultant, currently working as CTO at <a href="https://www.bookingsync.com" target="_blank">BookingSync</a>. I build ambitious and high performant web applications.</p>

  <p>Thanks to several years of experience and learning new skills every day, I had a chance to work on variety of problems, from building <strong>applications from scratch</strong> to helping in growing advanced startups in <strong>post-MVP phase</strong>. The problems I particularly enjoy working on and are areas of my expertise:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>enteprise integration using <strong>messaging systems</strong></li>
    <li>building <strong>microservices</strong></li>
    <li>building highly-performant <strong>REST APIs</strong></li>
    <li>making Rails applications <strong>highly scalable</strong> (yes, Rails apps do scale ;))</li>
    <li>implementing <strong>PCI DSS</strong> compliant </strong>microservices</strong>, especially for credit card payments' processing</li>
    <li><strong>refactoring legacy applications</strong> and making it maintainable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I strongly believe in <strong>always giving back</strong>. That's why I've been involed in many open source projects and have been sharing knowledge on multiple possibilities (including writing a <a href="https://karolgalanciak.com/test-driven-ember/" target="_blank">book</a> and releasing it for free for everyone). I'm always happy to do paid <strong>open souce</strong> work, <strong>mentor developers</strong> and write <strong>guest blog posts</strong>.</p>
