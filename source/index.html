<article class="about-root-page">
  <p>Hi! I'm Karol, a remote <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>Ember.js</strong> consultant. I build ambitious and high performant web applications and I <strong>would love</strong> to help your business expand and solve technical problems.</p>

  <p>Thanks to several years of experience and learning new skills every day, I had a chance to work on variety of problems, from building <strong>applications from scratch</strong> to helping in growing advanced startups in <strong>post-MVP phase</strong>. The problems I particularly enjoy working and are areas of my expertise:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>building <strong>REST APIs</strong></li>
    <li>implementing <strong>PCI DSS</strong> compliant </strong>microservices</strong> for credit card payments processing</li>
    <li>building beautiful and fast <strong>Single Page Applications</strong></li>
    <li>higher level <strong>architecture</strong></li>
    <li><strong>refactoring legacy code</strong> and making it maintainable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I've been working <strong>remotely</strong> since the very beginning and I've mastered the tools and the ways of communication and I would be happy to <strong>help your business</strong> with establishing <strong>remote-first</strong> workflow.</p>

  <p>I strongly believe in <strong>always giving back</strong>. That's why I've been involed in many open source projects and have been sharing knowledge on multiple possibilities. I'm always happy to do paid <strong>open souce</strong> work, <strong>mentor developers</strong> and write <strong>guest blog posts</strong>.</p>
