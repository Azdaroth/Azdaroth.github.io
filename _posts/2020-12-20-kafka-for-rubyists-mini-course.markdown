I've been recently planning to record a couple of tutorials for my team in [BookingSync](https://www.bookingsync.com), focusing mostly on monitoring and some other more advanced aspects of **Kafka** and **Karafka**. But if I was already recording something, then why not make it available publicly so that more developers could benefit from it?  So, in the end, I decided to make a bit more effort and recorded this **mini-course**, which will be available for everyone, for free ;).
